# Warband2PDF is a tool and a set of templates for customizable high quality Warband summaries

This project is for you, if you

- want to use [Warcrier.net](https://warcrier.net) to build your own warband
- then want to customize images and/or numbers in your warband
- have access to [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/publisher/?srsltid=AfmBOooAb7Hoa7UlxKvx7gruuHbA0DcCdDxB98eDkPRXjqU-JyVVciTk).

If you belong to the four people who fit this description, you can download this repo and use the code to run a local server with 

```
cd $pathToDirectory
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
and then go to localhost:8000 to run the script. It will generate three json files in a zip file. 

Use these json files as data merge inputs for the Affinity Publisher templates in this project and create customizable PDFs of your warband. You can join both templates together into one file, change the master page to adjust the header and go wild. Have fun.
